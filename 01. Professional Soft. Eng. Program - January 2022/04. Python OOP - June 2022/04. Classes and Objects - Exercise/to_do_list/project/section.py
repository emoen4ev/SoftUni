5.	To-do List

In this exercise, we are going to create a whole project step-by-step, starting with the project structure:

Create separate files for each class, as shown above.
You are tasked to create two classes: a Task class and a Section class.

The Section class should receive a name (string) upon initialization.
The task also has one instance attribute: tasks (empty list)

The Section class should also have four methods:
-	add_task(new_task: Task)
o	Adds a new task to the collection and returns "Task {task details} is added to the section"
o	If the task is already in the collection, returns "Task is already in the section {section_name}"

-	complete_task(task_name: str)
o	Changes the task to completed (True) and returns "Completed task {task_name}"
o	If the task is not found, returns "Could not find task with the name {task_name}"

-	clean_section()
o	Removes all the completed tasks and returns "Cleared {amount of removed tasks} tasks."

-	view_section()
o	Returns information about the section and its tasks in this format:
    "Section {section_name}:
     {details of the first task}
     {details of the second task}
     â€¦
     {details of the n task}"
"""

        self.tasks.append(new_task)
        return f'Task {new_task.details()} is added to the section'

    def complete_task(self, task_name: str):
        for task in self.tasks:
            if task.name == task_name:
                task.completed = True
                return f'Completed task {task_name}'
        return f'Could not find task with the name {task_name}'
