6.	Guild System

You are tasked to create two classes: a Player class and a Guild class.

The Guild class receives a name (string).

The Guild should also have one instance attribute players (an empty list which will contain the players of the guild).

The class also has 3 additional methods:
-	assign_player(player: Player)
o	Adds the player to the guild and returns "Welcome player {player_name} to the guild {guild_name}".
Remember to change the player's guild in the player class.
o	If he is already in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is already in the guild."
o	If the player is in another guild, returns "Player {player_name} is in another guild."

-	kick_player(player_name: str)
o	Removes the player from the guild and returns "Player {player_name} has been removed from the guild.".
Remember to change the player's guild in the player class to "Unaffiliated".
o	If there is no such player in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is not in the guild."

-	guild_info()
o	Returns the guild's information, including the players in the guild, in the format:
"Guild: {guild_name}
{first_player's info}
â€¦
{Nplayer's info}"
