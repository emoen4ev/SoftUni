8.	Pokemon Battle*

Note: For this problem, please submit a zip file containing a separate file for each of the classes,
with the class names provided in the problem description, and include them in a module named project.

You are tasked to create two classes: a Pokemon class in the pokemon.py file and a Trainer class in the trainer.py file.

The Pokemon class should receive a name (string) and health (int) upon initialization.
It should also have a method called pokemon_details that returns the information about the pokemon:
"{pokemon_name} with health {pokemon_health}"

The Trainer class should receive a name (string).
The Trainer should also have an attribute pokemons (list, empty by default).
The Trainer has three methods:
-	add_pokemon(pokemon: Pokemon)
        o	Adds the pokemon to the collection and returns "Caught {pokemon_name} with health {pokemon_health}".
            Hint: use the pokemon's details method.
        o	If the pokemon is already in the collection, returns "This pokemon is already caught"
        o	Hint: to import the Pokemon class, you should add "from project.pokemon import Pokemon"
-	release_pokemon(pokemon_name: string)
        o	Checks if you have a pokemon with that name and removes it from the collection.
            In the end, returns "You have released {pokemon_name}"
        o	If there is no pokemon with that name in the collection, returns "Pokemon is not caught"
-	trainer_data()
        o	The method returns the information about the trainer and his pokemon's collection in the format:
            "Pokemon Trainer {trainer_name}
             Pokemon count {the amount of pokemon caught}
             - {pokemon_details1}
             ...
             - {pokemon_detailsN}"
"""

from project.pokemon import Pokemon
from project.trainer import Trainer

pokemon = Pokemon("Pikachu", 90)
print(pokemon.pokemon_details())
trainer = Trainer("Ash")
print(trainer.add_pokemon(pokemon))
second_pokemon = Pokemon("Charizard", 110)
print(trainer.add_pokemon(second_pokemon))
print(trainer.add_pokemon(Pokemon("Charizard", 110)))
# print(trainer.add_pokemon(second_pokemon))
print(trainer.release_pokemon("Pikachu"))
print(trainer.release_pokemon("Pikachu"))
print(trainer.trainer_data())
